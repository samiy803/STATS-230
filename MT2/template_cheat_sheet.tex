\dfn{Example Definition}{Here is an example of a definition. It is a definition of a definition. But really, it is just some filler stuff as an example.}
\qs {} {Here is an example of a question. It is a question of a question. Can you answer it?}
\sol Here is an example of a solution. It is a solution of a solution. But really, it is just some filler stuff as an example.
\nt{Here is an example of a note. It is a note of a note. But really, it is just some filler stuff as an example.}
\clm{Topology}{}{Topology is cool}
\ex{Open Set and Close Set}{A set is open if it contains its interior. A set is closed if it contains its closure.}
\thm{}{If $x\in$ open set $V$ then $\exists$ $\delta>0$ such that $B_{\delta}(x)\subset V$}
\cor{}{By the result of the proof, we can then show...}
